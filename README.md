# Secret Message Encoder and Decoder 🔐

### Developed by: **Kirklen Allen**  
Hi there! 👋 I'm Kirklen Allen, a senior in Software Engineering who loves building fun and practical projects. This program is a super simple and exciting way to dive into the world of basic encryption, and it showcases one of the oldest tricks in the book: the Caesar Cipher!

## 🎯 What Does This Program Do?

This program lets you:
1. **Encrypt** a secret message by shifting the letters in your text forward in the alphabet by a fixed number (in this case, **3**). 🤫  
2. **Decrypt** the encoded message to reveal its original form by reversing the shift. 🕵️‍♂️

## 💡 How It Works (The Caesar Cipher)

A **shift value of 3** means each letter in your message is shifted **three places forward** in the alphabet. Here's an example of how it works:

### Encryption Example:
Original Message: **HELLO WORLD**  
Shift Value: **3**  
Encrypted Message: **KHOOR ZRUOG**  

### Decryption Example:
Encoded Message: **KHOOR ZRUOG**  
Shift Value: **3**  
Decoded Message: **HELLO WORLD**  

✨ Non-alphabet characters (like spaces, punctuation, or numbers) stay exactly the same. This ensures your text looks familiar even when encrypted!

## 🛠️ How to Use the Program

1. **Run the Program**  
   Launch the program in your Python environment.

2. **Enter Your Message**  
   Type a fun message you want to encrypt.

3. **See the Magic**  
   The program will:
   - Show your **encoded message** using a shift value of 3.
   - Decode it back into the **original message** for verification.

## 🚀 Why is This Fun?

- It’s like having your own **secret code language**! 🕶️  
- Great for learning how computers handle text and basic encryption.  
- Super easy to customize: you can experiment with different shift values for extra fun.
